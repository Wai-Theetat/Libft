# Libft

Libft is the very first project at 42 that introduces you to building your own C library. The goal is to reimplement a selection of standard C functions, as well as create additional utility functions and, optionally, linked list manipulation tools. This library will be useful for all your future C projects during your time at 42.

- Functions from the standard C library (e.g. `strlen`, `memcpy`, etc.)
- Utility functions for memory allocation, string manipulation, and more.
- (Bonus) Functions to manage singly linked lists.
